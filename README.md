# Hey developers, engineers, hackers. 
**This is important!** We want to respect your valuable time so **_PLEASE_** timebox this exercise.

Your current mission, should you choose to accept it, is to take a few (no more than two) hours to build an Orders REST API endpoint. We have created some starter templates for a few languages but you don't need to use them if you would prefer to roll your own.

## What we would like to see from this exercise:
* Create order endpoint
* List all orders by customer endpoint
* Update order endpoint
* Cancel order endpoint
* Tests to prove your code works as expected

**Currently supported languages templates:** C#, Go, Node.JS, Python

_We are open to other languages if you feel more comfortable in them. We have expertises in **Java**, **Kotlin**, and a few others._

If you don't see your language of preference on the list of languages above, **_please reach out_**. We are happy to discuss other langages as well.

## How to interact with this activity:
1. Fork this repo
2. Complete exercise with a language listed above (assuming you haven't chosen another, hipper language and discussed it with us)
3. Provide a link to the completed exercise to Jenny Hove [jenny.hove@sogeti.com]
